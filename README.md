## Rust/Axum PropelAuth Starter

This repo contains a Rust/Axum backend which uses [PropelAuth](https://www.propelauth.com/?utm_campaign=github) where users can sign up, login, manage their accounts, and view organization and member information.

[Here](https://docs.propelauth.com/example-apps/apps) are guides which will walk you through how to use this frontend code with a variety of frontend library options.

You can use this with any compatible frontend, like the [React PropelAuth Starter](https://github.com/PropelAuth/react-frontend-starter)
